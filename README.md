**NFTFriends**
NFTFriends is a Solidity smart contract for managing and minting non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain. This project utilizes OpenZeppelin's ERC721 standard contracts along with additional functionalities for enhanced control over NFT minting.

**Features**
Flexible Minting Phases: The contract supports multiple minting phases, each with its own reserved limits for premium and normal users.
Allowlist Functionality: Premium users can be whitelisted, allowing them to mint NFTs within their specified limits.
Admin Controls: Admin addresses have the authority to mint NFTs up to a platform-wide limit, ensuring centralized management of token distribution.
Pause and Unpause Functionality: The contract includes the ability to pause and unpause token transfers, providing safeguards against unexpected issues or vulnerabilities.

**Usage**
Minting Phases: Define and activate different minting phases with specific reserved limits for premium and normal users.
Allowlisting: Admins can populate the allowlist with premium user addresses, granting them special minting privileges.
Admin Minting: Admin addresses can mint NFTs up to the platform limit, either individually or in bulk.
User Minting: Regular users can mint NFTs within the specified limits during active minting phases.

**Smart Contract Architecture**
ERC721 Compliant: The contract inherits from OpenZeppelin's ERC721 standard contracts, ensuring compatibility with existing NFT infrastructure and marketplaces.
Modular Design: The contract is composed of multiple modules such as ERC721, ERC721Enumerable, ERC721URIStorage, Pausable, and Ownable, providing modular functionalities and ease of maintenance.
Counters Library: Utilizes the Counters library from OpenZeppelin for managing token IDs and address token counts.

**Deployment**
The contract is deployed on the Ethereum blockchain with configurable parameters such as maximum token supply and platform minting limits. 
Users can interact with the contract through Ethereum wallet interfaces or decentralized applications (dApps).
